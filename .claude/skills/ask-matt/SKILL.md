# Ask Matt

You don't remember every skill, so ask.

A **flow** is a path through the skills. Most paths run along one **main flow**, and two **on-ramps** merge onto it. Everything else is standalone, or a vocabulary layer that runs underneath.

## The main flow: idea → ship

The route most work travels. You have an idea and want it built.

1. **`/grilling`** — sharpen the idea by interview. Inside this repo it also captures what it learns in `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs via `/domain-modeling`; run it bare for a plan that doesn't live in a repo, or when you don't need the paper trail.
2. **Branch — can you settle every question in conversation?** If a question needs a runnable answer (state, business logic, a UI you have to see), detour through a prototype, bridged by **`/handoff`** in both directions (see Crossing sessions):
   - **`/handoff`** out, then open a fresh session against that file,
   - **`/prototype`** to answer the question with throwaway code,
   - **`/handoff`** back what you learned, and reference it from the original idea thread.
3. **Branch — is this a multi-session build?**
   - **Yes** → write the spec into `specs/` (create the directory on first use — this repo's standing reference is [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)) — then **`/to-tickets`** to split it into GitHub issues, each declaring its **blocking edges** per [`.claude/rules/issue-tracker.md`](.claude/rules/issue-tracker.md); any issue whose blockers are closed can be grabbed — kick off **`/deliver`** per issue, **clearing context between each one**.
   - **No** → **`/deliver`** right here, in the same context window.

   Either way, **`/deliver`** builds the issue by driving **`/tdd`** internally — one red-green slice at a time — then closes out by running **`/code-review`** (Standards + Spec), grilling the review, **`/simplify`**, and a spec-verification checklist, before offering a commit and merge to `main` for explicit user validation. Reach for **`/tdd`** on its own when you just want to build a concrete behaviour test-first without a full issue, and **`/code-review`** on its own whenever you want to review a branch against a fixed point.

### Context hygiene

Keep steps 1–3 in **one unbroken context window** — don't compact or clear until after `/to-tickets` — so the grilling, spec, and tickets all build on the same thinking. Each `/deliver` then starts fresh, working from the issue.

The limit on this is the **[smart zone](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/smart-zone)**: the window (~120k tokens on state-of-the-art models) within which the model still reasons sharply. If a session approaches it before `/to-tickets`, don't push on degraded — `/handoff` and continue in a fresh thread.

## On-ramps

A starting situation that generates work, then merges onto the main flow.

- **Something's broken** → **`/diagnosing-bugs`**. For the hard ones: the bug that resists a first glance, the intermittent flake, the regression that crept in between two known-good states. It refuses to theorise until it has a **tight feedback loop** — one command that already goes red on *this* bug — then fixes with a regression test. Its post-mortem hands off to **`/improve-codebase-architecture`** when the real finding is that there's no good seam to lock the bug down.

- **A huge, foggy effort — a greenfield project or a huge feature build, too big for one session** → **`/wayfinder`**, the most cognitively demanding flow here. When the way from here to the destination isn't visible yet, it charts a **shared map** of **decision tickets** on the issue tracker and resolves them one at a time — producing **decisions, not deliverables** — until the fog is pushed back and the way is clear. Where **`/grilling`** sharpens an idea you can hold in one session, wayfinder is for the idea you can't — and it's slower and denser, so save it for exactly that, never a well-scoped feature.

  When the map clears, **it hands off, it doesn't build**: merge onto the main flow by writing the map's linked decisions into a buildable spec under `specs/`, then `/to-tickets` and `/deliver` as usual. Looping the map straight into `/deliver` skips that collapse and throws the linked detail away — go straight to `/deliver` only when the effort turned out genuinely small.

## Codebase health

Not feature work — upkeep.

- **`/improve-codebase-architecture`** — run whenever you have a spare moment to keep the codebase good for agents to operate in. It surfaces **deepening opportunities**; picking one _generates an idea_ you can take into the main flow at `/grilling`. It's the survey that finds the candidates; **`/codebase-design`** (below) is the bench you design the chosen one on.

## Vocabulary underneath

Two model-invoked references that run *beneath* the other skills — each the single source of truth for its vocabulary. Reach for them directly when the **words**, not the process, are the problem; or let the skills above pull them in.

- **`/domain-modeling`** — sharpen the project's *domain* language: challenge a fuzzy term, resolve an overloaded word ("account" doing three jobs), record a hard-to-reverse decision as an ADR. It's the active discipline `/grilling` drives to keep `CONTEXT.md` a clean glossary.
- **`/codebase-design`** — the deep-module vocabulary (module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage, locality) for designing a module's *shape*: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface at a clean seam. `/tdd` and `/improve-codebase-architecture` both speak it.

## Crossing sessions

- **`/handoff`** — when a thread is full or you need to branch off (e.g. into a `/prototype` session), this compacts the conversation into a markdown file. You don't continue in place — you **open a new session and reference that file** to carry the context across. It's the bridge between context windows, in either direction. Use it when you want a **fresh session** but need the **current conversation preserved**.
- **`/compact`** (built-in) — stay in the **same conversation**, letting the earlier turns be summarized. Use it at **intentional breaks between phases**, when you don't mind losing the verbatim history. Don't compact mid-phase — the agent can lose its way. `/handoff` forks; `/compact` continues.

## Standalone

Off the main flow entirely.

- **`/prototype`** — a small, throwaway program that answers one design question: does this state model feel right, or what should this UI look like. Throwaway from day one — keep the answer, delete the code. It's the detour in step 2 of the main flow, but reach for it any time a design question is hard to settle on paper.
- **`/research`** — delegate reading legwork to a **background agent**: it investigates a question against **primary sources**, then leaves a cited Markdown file in the repo. Keep working while it reads. The file it produces is something to take *into* the main flow at `/grilling` — research feeds the thinking, it doesn't replace it.
- **`/teach`** — learn a concept over multiple sessions, using the current directory as a stateful workspace.
- **`/writing-great-skills`** — reference for writing and editing skills well.
